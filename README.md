# Bridging The Gap: Android App

### About

Bridging The Gap is an organization originated in Portland, Oregon that aims to provide human trafficking survivors with immediate resources to transition into society. There are numerous volunteer organizations willing to provide resources such as housing, food, and toiletry. No organization has everything, making it harder for people in the field to request resources in time.

With this Android app, requesting and providing resources is a breeze. Users can quickly request for items on their phone, and others able to help can get notified if they may be helpful.

The app has a strict onboarding process to prevent the network from being exploited by malicious parties.
